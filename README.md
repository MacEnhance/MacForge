## Functionallity notes 📝

- Loading plugins into most applications requires that [System Integrity Protection](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/208478/how-do-i-disable-system-integrity-protection-sip-aka-rootless-on-os-x-10-11) and Library validation are disabled
- Loading plugins into some applications may require the plugin must be *signed* and in the `/Library` directory
- Some applications installed by MacForge may not require `System Integrity Protection` or `Library Validation` to be disabled to function
