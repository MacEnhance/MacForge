New security features introduced in macOS Mojave prevent <appname> from functioning properly.

<appname> has determined that Apple Mobile File Integrity is disabled on your system.

Due to recent system updates you will not be able to add applications to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy. This can completely prevent some applications form functioning or break critical functionality.

In order restore these features and prevent future problems you must enable Apple Mobile File Integrity.

You can continue using <appname> by switching to disabling Library Validation instead.

After entering your password you will be required to restart for changes to take effect.
